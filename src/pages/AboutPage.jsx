                        <p>
                            Gary and David met at a cafe. Over the course of that conversation, they kept
                            returning to the same observation: businesses were losing real revenue every day
                            because nobody could respond to inbound leads fast enough. Most of the AI voice
                            tools on the market either sounded robotic, charged regardless of outcome, or
                            could not actually qualify a lead before handing it off.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They saw the gap clearly, and they saw a way to fill it. They decided to focus
                            their combined effort on one problem: building voice AI that qualifies leads
                            and books appointments as naturally as a top sales representative does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An initial prototype proved the concept worked. Months of platform development
                            followed. Today, Stellar Voice Agents works with clients across professional
                            verticals to deliver qualified bookings on their calendars every week. The
                            longest-running engagement has been live for six months and counting, with
                            consistent results from the day it went live.

                {/* WHY PERFORMANCE PRICING */}

                        <h2>Why performance pricing</h2>
                        <p>
                            After seeing how other companies in the space priced their services, David and
                            Gary made a decision. If the system works as well as they believe it does, they
                            should be willing to put their revenue on the line.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That is why the majority of SVA&apos;s revenue comes from per-booking fees. If SVA
                            does not book qualified meetings, SVA does not get paid. That is how confident
                            they are.
