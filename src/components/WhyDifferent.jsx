        body: 'We have built voice agents for sales qualification across real estate, solar, insurance, healthcare, home services, and more. We know which questions qualify a real buyer, which trigger objections, and which book the meeting. That depth of expertise is why our booking rates run 2x to 5x what generalist AI platforms deliver.'

        Icon: TrendingUp,
        title: 'Performance-based pricing. We earn when you earn.',
        body: 'Our pricing has a low monthly retainer plus a per-booking fee. The majority of what you pay only kicks in when we put a qualified meeting on your calendar.'

        Icon: Cpu,
        title: 'Premium tech stack. Full flexibility.',
        body: 'We use the most advanced voice AI technology available today. Natural voices with warm pacing, real hesitation, and the ability to handle interruptions. Most people on the other end of the call cannot tell they are talking to AI. We pair that with deep CRM integration, real-time analytics, and full call recording and transcription. Every call is logged, scored, and available for you to review.'
