# Modernization Plan for Stellar Voice Agents

Modernize the `stellarvoiceagents.com` website to create a premium, high-converting landing page. This involves a complete design overhaul using glassmorphism aesthetics and a refined copy strategy focused on benefits and social proof.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since the current workspace is empty, I will initialize a new React project using Vite. I will use **Vanilla CSS** for all styling to ensure maximum performance and bespoke design control.

> [!WARNING]
> I will be creating a few "placeholders" for testimonials and demos since the original site lacked real-world examples in these categories. I recommend providing real client names/results later.

## Proposed Changes

### Core Infrastructure
- Initialize Vite + React project.
- Establish a global CSS design system with HSL color tokens, typography, and glassmorphism utilities.

### Component Modernization
- **Hero Section:** Implement a high-impact header with a subtle animated background (e.g., floating orbs or grid lines).
- **Demo Section:** Create interactive "Agent Cards" with waveform visualizations to simulate "listening" to an agent.
- **Problem/Solution:** Use a split-screen or alternating layout with high-quality icons and refined copy.
- **Why Us (Features):** Modern grid layout using glass cards and hover-triggered micro-animations.
- **Testimonials [NEW]:** Add a dedicated section for social proof.
- **FAQ [NEW]:** Add an accordion-style FAQ section to handle common AI objections.
- **Founders/Team:** Modernize the bio section with a cleaner, more personal layout.

## Copy Strategy
| Current Headline | Proposed Modernized Headline |
| :--- | :--- |
| NEVER LOSE ANOTHER LEAD | **Never Let a Lead Go Cold Again.** |
| AI voice agents that engage... | **Your 24/7 AI Sales Team That Never Sleeps, Never Quits, and Always Closes.** |
| Smart Qualification | **Separate The Closers From The Tire-Kickers — Automatically.** |

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Build verification: `npm run build` to ensure no errors in the modernized build.
- Linting: `npm run lint` if configured.

### Manual Verification
- **Visual Audit:** Open `http://localhost:5555` and verify the glassmorphism effects, typography, and responsiveness.
- **Interactivity Check:** Verify all CTAs and the FAQ accordion function as expected.
- **Copy Review:** Confirm all modernized text is present and free of typos.
