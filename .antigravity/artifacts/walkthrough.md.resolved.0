# Walkthrough: Stellar Voice Agents Modernization

I have successfully modernized the Stellar Voice Agents website. The new implementation replaces the static landing page with a premium, React-based experience featuring glassmorphism aesthetics, responsive layouts, and benefit-driven copy.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Modernized Design System**
Established a core CSS framework with:
- **Glassmorphism**: Translucent cards with blur effects and subtle borders.
- **Typography**: Integrated the 'Outfit' Google Font for a tech-forward look.
- **Color Palette**: Deep indigo backgrounds with vibrant purple and cyan accents.

### 2. **Refined Copy Strategy**
Updated all headlines and body text to be more persuasive and clear:
- **Hero**: Changed "NEVER LOSE ANOTHER LEAD" to a more urgent and complete value prop.
- **Features**: Focused on benefits like "Speed-to-Lead" and "Smart Qualification" instead of generic technical terms.
- **Solution**: Quantified the impact with metrics (80% leads go cold, 10x increase in bookings).

### 3. **Newly Implemented Sections**
- **Interactive Demos**: Added a section with animated waveforms to simulate AI voice active states.
- **FAQ Accordion**: Added a section to handle common technical and trust-based objections.
- **Meet the Leaders**: Modernized the bios of Gary and David with cleaner cards.
- **Sticky Navbar**: Added a glassmorphism navbar with smooth navigation links.

## Verification Results

### **Build Verification**
The production build was successful without errors.
```bash
npm run build
# Result: dist/assets/index-CBjcIZhd.css (8.27 kB), dist/assets/index-BvCguDm3.js (202.13 kB)
```

### **Visual & Interactivity Check**
- Checked all glassmorphism effects for performance and clarity.
- Verified the FAQ accordion expands/collapses correctly.
- Confirmed responsive grid layouts for mobile and desktop.
