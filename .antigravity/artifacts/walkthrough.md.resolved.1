# Walkthrough: Stellar Voice Agents Modernization

I have successfully modernized the Stellar Voice Agents website. The new implementation replaces the static landing page with a premium, React-based experience featuring glassmorphism aesthetics, responsive layouts, and benefit-driven copy.

## Design Overhaul

The new site uses a deep indigo galactic theme with glowing glass containers, providing a high-tech feel suitable for an AI voice agent service.

> [!TIP]
> This site is ready for deployment. You can replace the placeholder founder images in [src/components/Team.jsx](file:///c:/Users/idead/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ionized-nadir/src/components/Team.jsx) once you have the final high-resolution headshots.
